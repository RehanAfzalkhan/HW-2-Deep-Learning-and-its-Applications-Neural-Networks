Q.1: Use the 10-class digits in MNIST training data-set and calculate the global PCA for all the digits. Keep the top 30 eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues.
1.
Display all 30 eigenvectors as images. Plot the top 30 eigenvlaues.
2.
For each digit (0 to 9) take one example and project it onto the top
a)
2 PCA eigenvectors and then reconstruct + calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed images.
b)
5 PCA eigenvectors and then reconstruct + calculate the MSE.
c)
20 PCA eigenvectors and then reconstruct + calculate the MSE.
d)
30 PCA eigenvectors and then reconstruct + calculate the MSE.
